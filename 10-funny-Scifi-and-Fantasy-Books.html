            Growing up with a reading list dominated by Terry Pratchett and
            Douglas Adams, I’ve come to believe that humor writers don’t always
            get the recognition they deserve. Crafting laughter with just words
            is a real art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comedy isn’t just about entertainment—it’s a way to delve into deep,
            thought-provoking topics. Humor can coax people out of their shells
            and make them see issues from fresh perspectives. Funny science
            fiction and fantasy novels can do more than amuse; they can leave a
            lasting impact. Just look at the Discworld series, with its insights
            ranging from Vimes’ Boots Theory of Economics to its wisdom on
            navigating a chaotic world.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re looking for something both escapist and insightful, check
            out these 10 hilarious sci-fi and fantasy novels. I’ve included a
            blend of established names like Connie Willis and up-and-coming
            authors like Kaliane Bradley to give you a variety of choices for
            your next read.

              >The Ministry of Time</a
            >
            by Kaliane Bradley
          </h2>
          <p>
            This witty novel’s unnamed narrator is a British-Cambodian woman
            working for a secret organization that, to study the effects of time
            travel, extracts people from different eras who otherwise would not
            have survived. Her job is to help these “expats” adjust to life in
            the present.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when she’s paired with 19th-century explorer Graham Gore, their
            shared bond over feeling displaced in the world upends everything
            she expected.

            >
            by Nadi Reed Perez
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you’re in the mood for a book that’s as hilarious as it is
            moving, this is the one for you. It follows recently deceased rock
            star Mal, who’s determined to contact her estranged sister Cris
            before moving on to whatever comes next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things get complicated, however, when sparks fly between her and the
            medium who agrees to help her with her unfinished business. Why is
            it that her love life finally takes off after she’s passed on?

              >To Say Nothing of the Dog</a
            >
            by Connie Willis
          </h2>
          <p>
            Taking its inspiration from Jerome K. Jerome’s
            <em>Three Men in a Boat</em>, this novel captures its delightfully
            absurd humor but with a speculative twist. While visiting Victorian
            England for a short mission and a little relaxation, time-traveling
            Oxford student Ned Henry’s trip becomes unbelievably messy when he
            loses his only contact and he discovers that a wrong move could
            cause a butterfly effect for World War II.

              >Someone You Can Build a Nest In</a
            >
            by John Wiswell
          </h2>
          <p>
            Between its sharp wit and thought-provoking social commentary, this
            horror comedy is an excellent readalike for Terry Pratchett fans.
            After being saved from monster hunters by a kindhearted woman named
            Homily, shapeshifter Shesheshen feels something for the human that
            she never has before…love? Possibly. But both have more pressing
            matters at hand, namely the curse killing off Homily’s family with
            links to Shesheshen’s traumatic past.

            <a href="https://amzn.to/4fAeOjQ" target="_blank">Prophet</a>
            by Sin Blaché and Helen MacDonald
          </h2>
          <p>
            The banter between special agents Adam Rubenstein and Sunil Rao
            makes this sci-fi thriller’s dark humor stand out. Estranged after a
            mission gone wrong, Rao and Rubenstein reunite to track down the
            origins of a drug that sends its targets into a nostalgia-induced
            delirium. What they discover throws their understanding of reality
            itself into chaos.

          <p>
            After waking up with amnesia, Gav is shocked to discover that the
            Dread Lord that all the goblin henchmen surrounding him keep talking
            about is none other than… him. But Gav doesn’t feel like a bad guy,
            despite the princess apparently locked in his dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            How’s he supposed to play along with the evil deeds people expect of
            him when he doesn’t even know who he wants to be?

          <p>
            Brother Nicephorus may be a cloistered monk in 11th-century England,
            but when he receives a saintly vision, he vows to burgle a holy
            relic with purported healing powers to save his city from the pox.
            His traveling companion, a treasure hunter named Tyun, is only too
            happy to take the fortunes promised to him for the journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            But a journey that begins with a vision is bound to take a mystical
            turn, one that transforms Brother Nicephorus and Tyun into very
            different people than when they set out from home.

          <p>
            Although it was created for one purpose—to kill anyone or anything
            that attacks its assigned research group—sentient android Murderbot
            would rather be left alone so it can watch TV. But despite its
            disdain for humans, it ultimately protects the ones in its charge
            when their mission goes awry.

          <p>
            Charles Yu (the Minor Universe 31 version of him, anyway) is a time
            travel technician. When a customer’s multiverse travels go
            pear-shaped, it’s him they call to clean things up. With his own

            himself into his desire to reunite with his lost inventor father.

            Blending fantasy and cosmic horror, this darkly humorous read stars
            Julie, a New York City monster hunter who’s already feeling her age
            in her early 30s. Folks in her career are often short-lived, with
            particularly gruesome deaths, and she fears her fate will be no
            different when she accidentally soul-bonds with an eldritch god.
