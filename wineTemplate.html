          <h2>How to Take Memorable Wine Tasting Notes</h2>

          <p>Whether you are writing white wine tasting notes, red wine tasting notes or even
            sparkling wine tasting notes, developing these six points on your wine tasting notes
            sheet will help you craft a memorable wine tasting note.</p>

          <p>I found that by creating a mini wine tasting note template in my notebook for each
            wine, I don’t miss an important aspect that I will later wish I had. I don’t have time
            to go back and read everything I am writing, so I put key indicators in the corners of
            each note. I don’t sketch an actual template for the wine, but I know that I need to
            see certain things quickly to know I got that job done. When I glance down and see
            that those notes are in place, I know that I’ve got a full note. Decide what you most
            want to know and write all of your notes in the same format, and you’ll see how
            quickly you can interpret your notes when you go back to them.</p>

          <p>Below is a wine tasting guide for writing great wine tasting notes. This serves as a
            good list for wine tasting notes for beginners that can be adapted over time. Of
            course, what will be most memorable is the flair that you add that makes each wine the
            most distinguishable for you when you comb back through your notes.</p>

          <p>Flair takes all sorts of forms. Does the wine remind you of an actor, a composer, a
            fashion designer? Would you drink that wine with a specific song or musical artist?
            Use whatever it takes to make your encounter with a wine more concrete.</p>

          <h3>Wine Details</h3>

          <p>Start with the basics and jot down the producer, the wine’s full name, the region of
            origin, its grape variety or varieties, its price and maybe its alcohol percentage.
          </p>

          <p>Also, note anything interesting with regard to its history, change of <a
              href="https://www.kj.com/people">winemakers</a>, vineyard elevation, vineyard soil
            type and such. Those kinds of details can sometimes be the memory trigger when a set
            of tasting notes all sound extremely similar upon review. Just don’t get so caught up
            writing down fascinating information about the wine that you don’t leave yourself time
            to fully assess the wine.</p>

          <h3>Appearance</h3>

          <p>Wine appearance today is less important than it once was thanks to our much-improved
            understanding of viticultural and winemaking practices. Unless I am writing a
            professional wine tasting note where color is expected, I only note the appearance of
            still wines when they are unusual. That is, I would note a wine that is very pale or
            dark given its grape varieties. If a wine is cloudy, I might note that the wine is
            unfiltered or possibly going through another fermentation. If I am tasting an older
            white or red wine, I might note how its color has become darker and more golden in a
            white wine tasting note or more brick-colored and paler in a red wine tasting note. I
            frequently note the appearances of <a href="https://www.kj.com/wine/rose">rosé
              wines</a> and sparkling wines as those can be much more diverse in the glass.</p>

          <h3>Aromas/Flavors</h3>

          <p>Aromas and flavors are the same thing. Even when we think we are tasting the flavor
            of raspberries, we are really only smelling raspberries. Humans only taste sweet,
            salty, bitter, sour and umami. See “Structure” below for noting those aspects.</p>

          <p>While this category is but one aspect of a wine, it is generally the one where
            tasting note writers obsess the most. It’s a berry, but which kind of berry? Is that
            coffee (beans or grinds) or dark chocolate?</p>

          <p>Note four or five aromas, but leave time to note the rest of the wine. Also, be sure
            to have a wide array of vocabulary on hand and think about fruits, flowers, spices,
            etc. in advance. Otherwise, you might wind up with a page where every wine tastes like
            plums and mocha. That likely won’t end up as a memorable wine tasting note.</p>

          <p>Within the fruit family, consider thinking of fruits within each of these
            sub-categories. Here I have listed them in approximate order of increasing sugar
            levels:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Citrus (lemon, grapefruit, kumquat)</li>
            <li>Melons (honeydew, cantaloupe)</li>
            <li>Pit Fruits (white peach, nectarine)</li>
            <li>Seed Fruits (pear, apple)</li>
            <li>Tropical Fruits (passion fruit, mango)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can do this with other categories of aromas to tease through other wine nuances.
            Consider baked goods notes, savory spices, nuts, trees and flowers and minerals and
            earthy.</p>

          <p>Other things to note in the aromas and flavors are whether they are subtle or
            powerful and whether or not they change in the glass.</p>

          <h3>Structure</h3>

          <p>A wine’s structure is composed of many parts. It includes acidity (the refreshment),
            tannins (the dryness - particularly for red wines, though they can be found in whites
            and rosés), body, alcohol and texture.</p>

          <p>For wine tasting basics, an easy way to note structure elements is to go with a
            simple low-medium-high scale for each of these structure points. You can introduce
            pluses and minuses to modify these basic gradients.</p>

          <h3>Finish</h3>

          <p>The finish of a wine is how long the wine’s taste remains on your palate. It stems
            from the wine’s flavor concentration balanced by its overall finesse. The longer the
            finish of a wine, the higher the quality of the wine.</p>

          <h3>Overall Impression/Rating</h3>

          <p>Many wine note takers find it useful to sum up their overall impression with some
            final indicator or rating. That could be a number of stars (or <a
              href="https://www.kj.com/blog/your-premier-guide-to-types-of-wine-glasses">wine
              glasses</a> – choose your <a href="https://www.whitewineemoji.net/" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby="audioeye_new_window_message">emoji</a>),
            a numerical rating or some other personal indicator. The point is to have a way to go
            back and distinguish between your two or three favorite wines amongst many and, even
            if their notes read almost equally positively, know for certain which you thought was
            better in the end.</p>
