          <h3> The Open House Polo Restaurant</h3>

          <h5>(Name/location)</h5>
          <p>The ‘Open House’ is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village between three national forests
            and close to the horse´s capital city, Chantilly. It is the favourite hangout place for people from the
            polo, horse races, and golf world.</p>

          <h5> (Atmosphere/decor)</h5>
          <p>As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting, a delightful marriage of antique cut
            stones and the luxuries of modernity. Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like
            kitchen where you can see the chefs working. For those who do not book a table and are waiting, there is a
            cosy lounge with aged leather armchairs and pictures of polo players displayed on the walls. </p>

          <h5>(The menu/dishes)</h5>
          <p>The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. I had the white asparagus accompanied by a
            mousseline sauce and poached eggs, while my friend tried the zucchini carpaccio served with sundries
            tomatoes and a mozzarella strudel. They were exquisite. The main course consisted in a risotto with scallop
            cooked in cream and a cassolette of coley with mussels, which really thrilled us. It all was followed by a
            delicious apple pie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. </p>

          <h5>(The ingredients/the wine/the prices)</h5>
          <p>All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs takes great care in
            selecting the best quality ingredients. The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large
            selection of the best wines of the region, which are pricy but worth sampling.</p>

          <h5>(The service/the waiters/the owner)</h5>
          <p> What a pity that the service does not accompany the high quality of the cooking. You can hardly get a
            smile out of the waitresses. Thankfully the owner and hostess, a middle-aged charming woman, is always
            around willing to exchange some kind words with all her clients.</p>

          <h5>(Recommendation)</h5>
          <p>Despite the high price of the food and the not so attentive waiters´ service, I had a pleasant dining
            experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason I highly recommend going to the Open
            House restaurant.</p>
