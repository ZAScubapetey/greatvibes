====== The great Set Up ======

I have setup up the wiki with user and namespaces. Also reverted back to the basic template as the idea of this wiki is just to contain the information I want to keep and not be too fancy and fragile.

(Remember to upload files to the general workspace in the media manager so that normal users can still view it)

The following users and roles have been set up for now

  * 'User' has access to general pages like the wordplay page and home.
  * 'Dnd' has access to the general pages and also the DnD5e information pages. 

----

To do:
  * Find a way of only showing the relevant pages in the sidebar
