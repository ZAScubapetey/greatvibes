====== The Great Paintening of '21 ======

After the meeting yesterday, Tony the painter/handyman let us know that he can start today with the prep work and that he should be done in a week.

He started with the preparations today so hopefully, he'll be done quickly and neatly as we cannot start with the rest until he is done. 

Anna and I popped over yesterday to clean the water meter and get a reading. We also started to measure the windows for curtains but will do it properly on Saturday morning and then head to the material shop to source materials. 

The all the carpets will get a cleaning but this will happen after the painting is done.

And in the meantime, we might start moving things into the garage to empty out the house a little bit as we are running out of packing space...
