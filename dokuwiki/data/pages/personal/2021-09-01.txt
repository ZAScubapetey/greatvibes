====== Cross Testing ======

First day of Spring!

Last night we got the keys to our new house and of course, we went to inspect and dream! It took us almost a half hour to find the water meter which was buried in the right-hand corner outside the yard.

I did a walk-through today with my father and the handyman. Looks like a few days of work and then we can move in!

The house looks excellent but we'll have to redo the kitchen and room cupboards. I want to put up water-saving tanks asap and also buy a bunch of wood for the fireplace as quickly as possible.

Application for the fibre line to be move has been sent in but I completely forgot about the insurance details change! 8-o
Hopefully, our broker will straighten that out with minimal hassle...

Overall it looks like we might just enjoy living there very much after we have made it our own.

Today I'm testing the Gdrive usability to store and backup the wiki. It seems like it might work but let us see.
