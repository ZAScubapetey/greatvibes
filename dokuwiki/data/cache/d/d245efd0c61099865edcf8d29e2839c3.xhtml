<div class="level1">

<p>
After the meeting yesterday, Tony the painter/handyman let us know that he can start today with the prep work and that he should be done in a week.
</p>

<p>
He started with the preparations today so hopefully, he&#039;ll be done quickly and neatly as we cannot start with the rest until he is done. 
</p>

<p>
Anna and I popped over yesterday to clean the water meter and get a reading. We also started to measure the windows for curtains but will do it properly on Saturday morning and then head to the material shop to source materials. 
</p>

<p>
The all the carpets will get a cleaning but this will happen after the painting is done.
</p>

<p>
And in the meantime, we might start moving things into the garage to empty out the house a little bit as we are running out of packing space…
