First day of Spring!
</p>

<p>
Last night we got the keys to our new house and of course, we went to inspect and dream! It took us almost a half hour to find the water meter which was buried in the right-hand corner outside the yard.
</p>

<p>
The house looks excellent but we&#039;ll have to redo the kitchen and room cupboards. I want to put up water-saving tanks asap and also buy a bunch of wood for the fireplace as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Overall it looks like we might just enjoy living there very much after we have made it our own

Today I&#039;m testing the Gdrive usability to store and backup the wiki. It seems like it might work but let us see.
