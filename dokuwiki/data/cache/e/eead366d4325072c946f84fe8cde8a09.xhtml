<p>
I have setup up the wiki with user and namespaces. Also reverted back to the basic template as the idea of this wiki is just to contain the information I want to keep and not be too fancy and fragile.
</p>

<p>
(Remember to upload files to the general workspace in the media manager so that normal users can still view it)
</p>

<p>
The following users and roles have been set up for now
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &#039;User&#039; has access to general pages like the wordplay page and home.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &#039;Dnd&#039; has access to the general pages and also the DnD5e information pages. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>
To do:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Find a way of only showing the relevant pages in the sidebar</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
