          <p class="lead">
            This dark fantasy adventure’s release was moved from April to
            August, and it is worth the wait! It’s a rip-roaring story about a
            guild of assassins who swear to three unbreakable vows: The contract
            must be just, only the target may be killed, and you must complete a
            job once you agree to do it. At the start, we meet Eveen the
            Eviscerator, one of the highly talented assassins, who has agreed to
            a new contract. But when the job turns out to be way more
            complicated, she refuses to complete it. Now she herself is in
            danger from the very people she worked with, running for her life
            while she searches for answers. P.S.: Don’t worry, there are not any
            dead cats.

            This month from the author* of the wildly popular Expanse series
            comes the first in an exciting new space opera series. It’s about
            the Carryx, a brutal alien race that has existed for centuries,
            ruining other species in the galaxy. When their existence comes
            under threat, they need humans for their survival. After the capture
            and kidnapping of some of the brightest humans, the people must
            figure out a way to survive and what they are going to do for the
            Carryx. This is the start of the story of one man, Dafyd Alkhor, a
            scientist who will emerge a champion — and the most hated man in
            history. <br />*It’s the pen name of two authors, Daniel Abraham and
            Ty Franck.

            The prolific T. Kingfisher is a Book Riot fave! This fantastic new
            novel is her take on the “Goose Girl” fairy tale. Cordelia lives an
            unusual, unhappy, and sometimes punishing existence as the daughter
            of an evil sorcerer. She’s never challenged her mother before, only
            lived her days subservient and silent. But when her mother brings
            home a kindly man and his sister, Cordelia grows fond of them, and
            she realizes she must act if she wants to save them from her
            mother’s nefarious plans.

            If you love stories about time travel, this is a great pick for you!
            In the future, humans have discovered pocket worlds, defined as “a
            geographically small, hidden offshoot of our own reality, sped up or
            slowed down by time.” Exploration of these pockets is an exciting
            new way to hopefully find new solutions for Earth’s problems. But
            forty years later, like all things, corporations have taken over
            pocket exploration, and a disgraced scientist (who wears the pocket
            universe where her estranged wife lives around her neck) has one
            chance to right these wrongs and save humanity from itself.

          <p class="lead">
            A new novel from award-winning author Nalo Hopkinson is always
            reason to celebrate! In this new fantasy, Veycosi, a student of
            music and history, sets out to learn from the rare Alamat Book of
            Light to become a scholar in Chynchin. But instead, he finds himself
            stuck in a complicated battle of danger and dark forces, where an
            ancient invading army approaches, children are disappearing, and the
            statues of island witches are coming to life.

            This charming novel was a runaway hit in Japan! How can you go wrong
            with cats? In this magical fantasy, being kind to cats really pays
            off. Because the legend goes, if you’re kind to the right cat, it
            will take you to a magical coffee shop that you can’t find on your
            own. This special shop is staffed by talking cats (purristas?), who
            will impart wisdom, read your star chart, and supply you with
            delicious food and drink.

            This magical mystery is a huge hit in the UK, thanks in part to
            TikTok. Now being released in the US, it tells the tale of a special
            voyage that ends in murder. To celebrate one thousand years of peace
            in Concordia, the emperor’s ship sets out on a voyage with the
            twelve magical province heirs. When the heirs start being murdered,
            it will be up to Ganymedes Piscero, the only un-magical heir and the
            disappointment of his family, to find the killer.
